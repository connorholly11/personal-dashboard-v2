Updated Personal Dashboard Development Plan


2. Dashboard Layout

Design an intuitive, user-friendly interface
Create separate sections for different features (workouts, diet, habits, reflections, etc.)
Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop use

3. Daily Structure

Display non-negotiable tasks and reminders for each day
Integrate with Google Calendar (see section 15 for details)
Show context for each item when applicable

4. Weekly Schedule

Implement a weekly view with the following structure:

Monday to Friday: Show daily tasks and workouts
Thursday: Prompt to decide weekend work day
Weekend:

Designated work day: Mark as "Caffeine Day"
Other day: Mark as "Social Media Day"





5. Workout Tracker

Create a workout schedule with the following structure:

Monday: Upper body
Tuesday: Legs
Wednesday: Run
Thursday: Upper body
Friday: Legs
Saturday & Sunday: Workout, hike, or walks


Set consistent workout time from 2pm to 4pm daily
Allow input and tracking of specific lifts and exercises
Provide progress visualization (charts, graphs)

I will color code with reps and graph with weight. so the graph shows reps, but the dots
on the graph will be color coded based on amount of reps. 0-5 red, 6-9 yellow, 10-12 green.


6. Diet Tracker

Implement a food logging system
Provide a database of common foods with preset macros
Allow custom food entries
Calculate and display daily macro totals
Show nutritional goals and progress

7. Habit Tracking

Create a list of daily habits to track
Implement checkboxes for habit completion
Display habit streaks and completion rates
Include flexible options (e.g., "followed caffeine rule")
Integrate with calendar view to show habit adherence over time
Implement 75 Hard challenge tracking (if applicable)

8. Daily Reflection

Integrate with existing NoteTranscriber feature
Provide interface for daily audio recording
Implement automatic transcription of audio to text
Store daily entries with timestamps
Create a browsing interface for past reflections and transcriptions
Implement an export feature to download all entries at once, including dates

9. Data Persistence

Set up a secure database to store all user data
Implement regular data backups
Ensure data is retrievable across sessions and devices

10. Customization Options

Allow users to modify preset options (e.g., workout times, meal plans)
Provide the ability to add or remove tracked habits
Let users customize dashboard layout and color schemes

11. Reporting and Analytics

Generate weekly and monthly reports on:

Habit adherence
Workout progress
Diet and nutrition


Create visualizations (graphs, charts) for easy data interpretation
Provide insights and trend analysis

12. Notifications and Reminders

Implement a notification system for:

Upcoming tasks
Habit reminders
Workout schedules


Allow customization of notification preferences
Integrate with mobile push notifications and email

13. Mobile Responsiveness

Ensure the dashboard is fully functional on mobile devices
Optimize layout and interactions for touch interfaces
Implement a progressive web app for improved mobile experience

14. Google Calendar Integration

Set up Google Cloud project and enable Google Calendar API
Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure Google account authentication
Create functionality to:

Fetch events from Google Calendar
Update dashboard with calendar events
Push dashboard events to Google Calendar


Allow users to choose which calendars to sync
Set up regular sync intervals (e.g., hourly, daily)
Implement conflict resolution for events updated in both places

15. Documentation and README Updates

Create and maintain a comprehensive README file including:

Project overview and purpose
Setup instructions
Usage guide
List of features
Technologies used
Contribution guidelines (if applicable)


Update documentation for each feature as it's developed or modified
Include code comments for complex logic or non-obvious functionality
Create user documentation explaining all dashboard features and how to use them

Instructions for AI Developer:

Review this complete plan thoroughly.
Break down each section into specific development tasks.
Prioritize tasks based on core functionality and user needs.
Begin with user authentication and basic dashboard structure.
Implement core features (workout tracker, diet tracker, habit tracking) one at a time.
Integrate Google Calendar early in the process to ensure proper sync of events and reminders.
Regularly update the README and documentation as you develop each feature.
Seek user feedback on UI/UX and adjust as necessary.




can we have it where someone doesn't need to be logged in to see my dashboard, but they do need to be logged in to chaneg 
anything in my dashboard? I'd rather have that. for me, right now it's just about making my own dashboard. 
the login is really just so no one else can mess with my dashboard, but I still want people to be able to look at it. 
I want this to be a kind of new sort of blog. instead of writing. I just openly share my data, and my thoughts. 
and people can follow along if they will. able to hook in peoples data from different sources.
